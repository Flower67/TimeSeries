# Time Series

## Time Series Analysis Conclusions
Based on my time series analysis, I would not buy the yen now as the price will decrease based on my predictions.
Utilizing the Garch model, the risk of the Yen is expected to increase. This is noted by the hightened volatility of the data.
I would not feel confident using these models for trading purposes. I would need additional data to determine if the confidence levels would rise and if the volatility would decrease.

## Regression Analysis Conclusions
Based on the root mean squared error of the out-of-sample and the in-sample data, the model performs better on the out-of-sample data. However, neither rmse are adequate indicators that this model will confidently predict Yen Futures. The out-of-sample root mean squared is lower at 0.42 suggesting a model that is slightly better equipped when comparing Lagging Returns to Settle prices. The in-sample rmse is hight at nearly 0.6 suggesting a model that is more likely than not to predict incorrect Yen Futures. Based on the two rmse, I would continue testing other models to find a more confident predictor of Yen Futures.
